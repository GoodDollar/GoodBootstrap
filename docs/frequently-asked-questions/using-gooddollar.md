<summary>Why do I have to wait for my next claim?</summary>

<summary>How many G$ do I get every day (24 hours)?</summary>

While G$ is distributed every day, there is no way of knowing in advance how much a GoodDollar claimer will receive on any given day when making the claim. The distribution process depends on a daily basis. Within each 24-hour cycle, a specific amount of G$ is earmarked for distribution as basic income. \
\
The amount of G$ distributed is determined by the average number of active users over the past 14 days (with the number of claimers potentially varying each day). This daily allocation is distributed evenly, ensuring each claimer receives an equal share. Any unclaimed G$ is then rolled over to augment the distribution pool for the following day.\

<summary>How do I move my G$ to another wallet?</summary>

You can send G$ to wallets compatible with the Fuse and Celo Networks, depending on the chain you're sending G$ from. However, sending G$ to wallets incompatible with these networks will result in the loss of your funds. To ensure compatibility, consult the wallet documentation of the respective wallets.

Sending G$ from one GoodWallet address to another GoodWallet address is always compatible.

To send G$ to another wallet, you just need the wallet address to which you want to send money.

1. Make sure you are in the right Network where you want to send your G$. You can check and switch Network on the top left corner of your wallet.
2. Select “send” in the left side of the big button “Claim”.
3. Write the amount of G$ you want to send and select “send via address”
