<summary>Passing face-verification</summary>

To claim free G$’s, you’ll need to go through a short Face Verification (FV) process to verify that you are a unique and live user. This is to prevent duplicate accounts and misuse of the system.

Here are some tips to successfully complete the face verification so you can access your GoodDollar wallet. That’s where the fun begins.

* The face verification has strong requirements for image quality (e.g. image detail and color balance). Make sure your selfie is high-resolution (check your camera settings), not blurry, and has lots of light.

If you get the error message that your image “won't pass liveness check,” try these tricks:

* Adjust the lights in the room you're passing FV. Your face shouldn't be overexposed or too dark, having pixel artifacts.
* Clean your webcam lens using the special lens cleaning wipes (for digital cams) or LCD display cleaning wipes or at least with a soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol.
* Adjust your webcam settings. Make sure you are using the highest resolution setting possible.
* Check your webcam connection. Some webcam models require a USB 3.0 or type C connection to provide the maximum resolution
* Try using another webcam with a higher resolution (more megapixels) to pass the face verification step. You can also try using a smart phone camera (yours or a friends) to complete the step.&#x20;

<summary>Help! It says "I have a Twin"</summary>

If you are seeing this message, it is likely because you have created two GoodWallet accounts. Try to recall which other sign-up method you used in the past to create your account.

If this is the case, you will need to delete the new account you created. A helpful indicator of a new account is the absence of any transactions in the wallet. This indicates that you have never been able to claim from this wallet since you already have an existing one.

To delete an account in the GoodWallet, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GoodWallet menu on the top right of your screen, select "Settings," and choose "Delete Account." Follow the prompts to confirm.
2. You will get a message that your account is being deleted. Then you have to wait 24 hours
3. You will get a message that your wallet account is being deleted. Wait 24 hours after deleting your old account to be able to claim on your other wallet account without encountering a twin error.
