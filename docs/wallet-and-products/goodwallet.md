A [bridge](../frequently-asked-questions/web3-basic-knowledge-and-security-tips-by-consensys.md#what-is-a-bridge) is a tool built to move assets from one network to another.

One of GoodWallet’s features is an embedded bridge to move (”bridge”) G$ tokens seamlessly to and from Celo <> Fuse.

3. Choose the desired amount for bridging, then proceed and confirm.
4. Please allow a few moments for the transaction to appear in your transactions tab and for your balance to be updated.

There are limits to the Microbridge: you may bridge up to 5M G$ per transaction, with a daily limit of 30M G$ per wallet. The fees to use the Microbridge are 0.15% per transaction, with a minimum fee of 10 G$ and a maximum fee of 1M G$.
