<summary>How do I claim G$ UBI?</summary>

By accessing the “Claim” application on the mainpage. Claiming GoodDollars requires the user to verify uniqueness and liveness through Face Verification. This check will occasionally need to be redone. More information about GoodDollar and this process can be found [here](https://docs.gooddollar.org/frequently-asked-questions).&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>What about gas?</summary>

All blockchain transactions [require gas](https://docs.gooddollar.org/frequently-asked-questions/web3-basic-knowledge-and-security-tips-by-consensys). Gas is typically paid with the network in question’s native token and it’s the users responsibility to ensure sufficient gas is available for sending and exchanging tokens.

GoodDollar’s faucet provides the user with just sufficient gas on Celo and Fuse to claim G$ daily, meaning that sending and exchanging token may not necessarily be possible until the user have accrued sufficient gas by other means. It also means that if the user chooses to spend the GoodDollar sponsored gas on sending or exchanging tokens, the user will not necessarily have enough gas to perform the UBI claims for up to a few days.
