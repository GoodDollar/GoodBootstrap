# GoodID & GoodOffers

<details>

<summary>What is GoodID?</summary>

_GoodID is currently in its pilot stage, and therefore has limited functionality._

GoodID is a decentralized identification solution (DID). This means that you own your data and credentials, and decide who can “write” new data and credentials, as well as who can “read” your data and credentials. We built GoodID to allow partners an easy access to GoodDollar's community and to distribute campaigns, funds, and other opportunities to members of the GoodDollar protocol.

<summary>What is GoodOffers?</summary>

GoodOffers are opportunities to earn additional income, available to you based on your GoodID information. Note that you will only see GoodOffers if you said “Yes, I accept” to the screen “You might qualify for extra money disbursements.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I’ve disputed part of my GoodID?</summary>

Information you've marked as incorrect will show as "Unverified" on your GoodID.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I accept an offer I’ve skipped in the past?</summary>

When you skip an offer, you can choose to see that offer again. It will show up next time you claim. If you chose to not be shown the offer again, you will need to delete and then redo your Face ID / GoodID upgrade to see the offer again.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why don’t I see all my GoodID information on my device?</summary>

You will only see all GoodID upgrade info on the device you used to make the upgrade.

If you want to use another device or dapp, you can upgrade again on that device. For GoodDapp, this can be done by visiting [https://gooddapp.org/](https://gooddapp.org/) > GoodID, connecting your wallet and pressing "upgrade.”

<summary>How are my age and gender determined?</summary>

We use [Amazon Rekognition ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_Gender.html)to predict your age and gender.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do you know my location?</summary>

There are two different ways that we determine location:

* Using your IP address (the location through which you are accessing the internet).
* (If you sign into GoodWallet via your mobile number) the country code of your phone number.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does my location show as Unverified?</summary>

There are a few reasons your location may show as Unverified:

* You did not give device permissions
* You are using a VPN
* Due to another error, for example if we could not match your location with a country

If you would like your location to show in the future, please resolve the issue above and delete then redo your FaceID / GoodID upgrade by using another device or deleting your device or browser’s local storage.

<summary>Why are you collecting my video?</summary>

Red Tent’s offers are the first (pilot) offers utilizing GoodID and GoodOffers. As such, we are collecting some information for this short pilot period for the purpose of internal learning & refinement.

Your video may be reviewed by the GoodLabs or partner teams for verification purposes. Your video will not be shared or used publicly, and will be erased after a period of time.
