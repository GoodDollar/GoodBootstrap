# Protocol V2

## **Intro**

**GoodDollarV2 is a smart contract upgrade that enables core functions for the GoodDollar protocol to scale.**

{% hint style="info" %}
[This blog post](https://www.gooddollar.org/gooddollarv2-launches-the-epoch-of-defi-for-good/) provides an overview of what V2 does and why it matters to you and the world.
{% endhint %}

* GoodDollar leverages yield farming and liquidity mining rewards to encourage capital to flow towards the protocol, enabling the sustainable generation of UBI.
* V2 is a smart contract upgrade to expand functionality and open-source launch of a [protocol user interface](../protocol-v2-user-guides/deploy-your-own-gooddollar-ui.md), deployed by community members.
* V2 enables members to [stake](../protocol-v2-user-guides/stake-v2.md) in Compound or Aave and earn #GoodRewards while at the same time funding [#CryptoUBI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cryptoubi\&src=typed\_query) for all.
* Now, members can buy and sell G$ directly in the [GoodDollar Reserve](../protocol-v2-user-guides/buy-and-sell-gusd.md), a key feature that enables the economy to scale.
* V2 introduces a new governance model with the launch of the community-owned [GoodDAO](https://www.gooddollar.org/good-governance-distribution-results-from-the-snapshot/), which will determine the protocolâ€™s future direction.&#x20;
