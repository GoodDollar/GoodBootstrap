# Welcome to GoodDocs!

Welcome! [GoodDollar.org](https://gooddollar.org) is a decentralized universal basic income protocol. Here you can find all the open-source documentation for the smart contracts and interfaces!

Let's get started:

### What is Gooddollar?

[GoodDollar](http://www.gooddollar.org) is a people-powered framework to generate, finance, and distribute global basic income via the GoodDollar token (“G$ coin”). Its goal is to provide a baseline standard of living and reduce wealth inequality through the creation of a universal basic income (UBI).&#x20;

GoodDollar leverages new protocols and smart contracts to deliver a “trickle-up” value structure, which places money in the hands of those who need it most. This is the reverse of the conventional trickle-down approach to capital, credit, and interest-bearing money.

A digital asset that operates within the emerging ecosystem of decentralized and open finance, G$ coin is backed by a monetary reserve of cryptocurrencies and thus has tangible value. G$ coins are liquid and convertible to other cryptocurrencies, and will be available to buy and sell directly via the GoodDollar GoodReserve smart contract.

The value in the GoodDollar reserve comes from the interest that is generated from Supporters who stake cryptocurrencies in decentralized third-party protocols. Through the amassed reserve interest, G$ coins are minted. They are used to pay Supporters market-rate interest payments, while a daily amount of G$ coins is set aside to be distributed as basic income.

There are four main components to the Gooddollar project:

1. [Protocol](./#gooddollar-protocol)
2. [Protocol's Dapp](./#gooddollar-dapp-v2-not-yet-deployed)
3. Easy to use [Wallet](./#gooddollar-wallet) with built-in community features
4. Eco-system [Dashboard](http://dashboard.gooddollar.org)

### GoodDollar Protocol

* GoodDollar offers a new standard for creating and distributing basic income via G$ token.
* The Gooddollar Protocol is a set of rules (i.e. Smart Contracts) which&#x20;
* [GoodDollar V2](protocol-v2/) is a major contract upgrade yet to be deployed
* [GoodDollar V1](smart-contracts-guide/) was initially deployed in August 2020.&#x20;
* Some Guides have been documented by the community. Feel free to contribute.
* Everything is open-sourced and free to use on [Github](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodContracts).
* [V2 Staking Good Rewards Scheme](protocol-v2/elements-of-the-gooddollar-ecosystem.md#4.-staking-rewards-annual-percentage-returns)

### GoodDollar Dapp

* Serves as visual interface to the protocol core smart contracts on Ethereum mainnet.
* The Dapp enables to stake, buy/sell G$ directly to reserve, and governance functionality.
* The Dapp is 100% open-source, deployed and managed by community stakeholders. You can even deploy your own UI.
* Below are community deployed UI, use at your own risk!
  * goodswap.xyz

### GoodDollar Wallet

* Simple, mobile-friendly web app for members to receive daily G$ allocation.
* [Wallet Developer Guides](developer-guides/) provide an overview of the architecture of our wallet application and our approach to decentralized storage and identity.
* [GoodDAPP - Wallet WebApp](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodDAPP)​
* [GoodServer - webapp backend](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodServer)**​**

We have a repo[ GoodBoostrap](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodBootstrap) to provide you with a one-click development environment installation process
