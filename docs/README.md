# Welcome to GoodDocs

Here you can find the GoodDollar's project documentation.

You can find high level guides at [Developer Guides](developer-guides/) to understand the architecture of our wallet application and our approach to decentralized storage and identity.

In some of the guides we also have links to issues you could start with. The complete list is in our github repos

* [GoodDAPP - wallet webapp](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodDAPP)
* [GoodServer - webapp backend](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodServer)
* [GoodContracts - POC contracts for UBI and wallet](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodContracts)

We have a repo [GoodBoostrap](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodBootstrap) to provide you with a one-click development environment installation process

You can also find the code JSDocs in a searchable and more readable format [here]().
