Here you can find the GoodDollar's project documentation.

You can find high level guides at [Wallet Developer Guide](developer-guides/) and [Smart Contracts Developer Guide](smart-contracts-guide/) to understand the architecture of our wallet application and our approach to decentralized storage and identity.

Main repos of the project are:

* [GoodServer - webapp backend](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodServer)
* [GoodContracts - ](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodContracts)Ethereum smart contracts for DAO and UBI

We have a repo [GoodBoostrap](https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodBootstrap) to provide you with a one-click development environment installation process
