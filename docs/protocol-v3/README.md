# Protocol V3

## **Intro**

**GoodDollar V3 is a smart contract upgrade that enables core functions for the GoodDollar protocol to scale.**

{% hint style="info" %}
[This blog post](https://www.gooddollar.org/gooddollarv3-is-coming/) provides an overview of what V3 does and why it matters to you and the world.
{% endhint %}

GoodDollar protocol’s mission is to issue a sustainable crypto universal basic income, as a public good, that members are able to use G$ as a medium of exchange.&#x20;

All proposed changes are designed to:

* encourage usage and engagement among active G$ holders and community members
* reduce the rate of leverage of the currency, to encourage sustainable growth with minimal price volatility
* lay the groundwork for the GoodDAO to begin to propose, lead and fund community-led initiatives
* V3 eliminates G$ Staking APY Rewards for Mainnet Stakers
* The Speed of Annual G$ Minting/Issuance has been reduced by the passing of Protocol V3: Reserves Ratio Decline from 20% → 15% annually
* V3 also allocate 10% of the daily G$ UBI mint towards savings rewards and another 10% of the daily G$ UBI mint to fund a GoodDAO controlled community fund.
* Expand G$ token and protocol to Celo blockchain
