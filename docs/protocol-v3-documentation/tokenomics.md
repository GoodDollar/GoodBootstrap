# Tokenomics

In the realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency, GoodDollar stands out as a unique project with a mission that goes beyond financial gains. Rooted in a commitment to financial inclusion and wealth redistribution, the GoodDollar token (G$) is underpinned by a set of core design principles that make it both sustainable and impactful:

**Sustainability: A Natural Equilibrium üå≥**

GoodDollar's foundational principle is sustainability. The generation of G$ Universal Basic Income (UBI) is intricately tied to the flow of new deposits into the GoodReserve of the protocol. This means that as new deposits enter the ecosystem, G$ UBI is generated, maintaining a harmonious equilibrium between the supply and demand of GoodDollars.

**Stability: Striking the Right Balance üé†**

G$ is meticulously designed to maintain a level of stability that is "enough." To achieve this, it is collateralized by stablecoins within the reserve. This collateralization acts as a stabilizing force, mitigating extreme price volatility, and making G$ a reliable and secure digital asset.

**Liquidity: Trust and Incentives ‚ôªÔ∏è**

Ensuring token liquidity is crucial for any cryptocurrency's success. GoodDollar accomplishes this by relying on the primary market of the GoodReserve. This approach instills trust in users and creates incentives for liquidity providers and market makers to facilitate secondary markets, thereby enhancing the overall liquidity of G$.

### _The Basics of GoodDollar Tokenomics_

Now, let's delve into the core mechanics of GoodDollar's tokenomics:

**Augmented Bonding Curve: The Heart of G$ üíô**

The G$ token operates on an Augmented Bonding Curve, which is backed by a monetary reserve. The token's price is automatically calculated using a modified version of the BancorV1 formula. This innovative approach to token economics ensures a dynamic pricing mechanism.

**On-Demand Issuance: Balancing Supply and Demand ‚öñÔ∏è**

G$ issuance is not arbitrary but rather responds to demand. New G$ are minted as fresh DAI deposits flow into the GoodDollar Reserve, and they are burned when they are returned, meticulously maintaining equilibrium between the token's supply and demand dynamics.

**Liquidity at the Core ‚ôªÔ∏è**

G$ is fully liquid, offering seamless exchangeability through the GoodDollar Reserve, which effectively functions as a primary market maker. This liquidity ensures that users can effortlessly trade G$ as needed.

**Multi-Asset Reserve: Expanding Horizons üé®**

GoodDollar's reserve isn't static. It will evolve over time to include various assets, such as CDAI, stables, reserve-based assets, and blue-chip cryptocurrencies, thereby diversifying the underlying assets supporting G$.

###

### _Protocol Fundamentals_

The core of GoodDollar's tokenomics is rooted in robust fundamentals:

**Reserve-Backed Token: A New Paradigm üî∑**

GoodDollar represents a new paradigm in the crypto world as a reserve-backed token operating on an augmented bonding curve. Notably, there is no pre-mint or Token Generation Event (TGE). Instead, new cDAI deposits into the Reserve trigger the minting of G$.

**A Force for Good: Funding UBI and Community Initiatives üí™**

The flexibility of GoodDollar extends to how it utilizes earnings and fees. Any protocol or fee generated within the ecosystem can be directed towards the GoodReserve, effectively fueling G$ issuance, including UBI. Beyond UBI, G$ issuance supports community initiatives and rewards users who actively contribute to the protocol.



In summary, GoodDollar's tokenomics is a powerful blend of sustainability, stability, and liquidity, underpinned by innovative design principles. By ensuring that its tokenomics align with its mission to foster financial inclusion and wealth redistribution, GoodDollar is not just another cryptocurrency; it's a force for good in the world of decentralized finance.
